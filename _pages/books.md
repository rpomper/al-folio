<p> Below are some of my favorite books from each year.


<h2 class="year">{{2023}}</h2>

<img height=300 alt="Book cover for Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366775928i/17465709.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3> Braiding Sweetgrass: </h3>
<h4>Indigenous wisdom, scientific knowledge, and the teachings of plants</h4>
<h4> Robin Wall Kimmerer </h4>
First published 2013 <br><br>

<p> As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these lenses of knowledge together to show that the awakening of a wider ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings are we capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learning to give our own gifts in return. </p>

<h3> Gideon the Ninth </h3>
<h4> Tamsyn Muir </h4>
First published 2019 <br><br>

<p>The Emperor needs necromancers.
<br><br>
The Ninth Necromancer needs a swordswoman.
<br><br>
Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more time for undead bullshit.
<br><br>
Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood nemesis won't set her free without a service.
<br><br>
Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon's sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.

<h2 class="year">{{2021}}</h2>

<img height=300 alt="Book cover for Know My Kname by Chanel Miller" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1567612158l/50196744.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3> Know My Name </h3>
<h4> Chanel Miller </h4>
First published 2019 <br><br>

<p> She was known to the world as Emily Doe when she stunned millions with a letter. Brock Turner had been sentenced to just six months in county jail after he was found sexually assaulting her on Stanford's campus. Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral-viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time.
<br><br>
Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways-there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.
<br><br>
Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. It also introduces readers to an extraordinary writer, one whose words have already changed our world. Entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic. </p>

<h2 class="year">{{2020}}</h2>

<img height=300 alt="Book cover for March by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461533354i/29844341.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3> March </h3>
<h4> John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, Nate Powell </h4>
First published 2013 <br><br>

<p> Before he became a respected Congressman, John Lewis was clubbed, gassed, arrested over 40 times, and nearly killed by angry mobs and state police, all while nonviolently protesting racial discrimination. He marched side-by-side with Martin Luther King as the youngest leader of the Civil Rights Movement that would change a nation forever.
<br><br>
Now, experience John Lewis' incredible story first-hand, brought to life in a stunning graphic novel trilogy. With co-writer Andrew Aydin and Eisner Award-winning artist Nate Powell, John Lewis' MARCH tells the story of how a poor sharecropper's son helped transform America, from a segregated schoolhouse to the 1963 March on Washington and beyond. </p>

<h2 class="year">{{2019}}</h2>

<img height=300 alt="Book cover for Lies My Teacher Told Me by James W. Loewen" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1255592395i/296662.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3> Lies My Teacher Told Me: </h3>
<h4> Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong </h4>
<h4> James W. Loewen </h4>
First published 1995 <br><br>


<p> This national best-seller is an entertaining, informative, and sometimes shocking expose of the way history is taught to American students. Lies My Teacher Told Me won the American Book Award and the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship.
<br><br>
James W. Loewen, a sociology professor and distinguished critic of history education, puts 12 popular textbooks under the microscope-and what he discovers will surprise you. In his opinion, every one of these texts fails to make its subject interesting or memorable. Worse still is the proliferation of blind patriotism, mindless optimism and misinformation filling the pages.
<br><br>
From the truth about Christopher Columbus to the harsh reality of the Vietnam War, Loewen picks apart the lies we've been told. This audiobook, narrated by Brian Keeler (The Hurricane, "All My Children") will forever change your view of the past.</p>

<img height=300 alt="Book cover for Beloved by Toni Morrison" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1632283781i/6149.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3> Beloved </h3>
<h4> Toni Morrison </h4>
First published 1987 <br><br>

<p> Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Toni Morrison's Beloved is a spellbinding and dazzlingly innovative portrait of a woman haunted by the past.
<br><br>
Sethe was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later she is still not free. She has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad, yet she is still held captive by memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm where so many hideous things happened. Meanwhile Sethe's house has long been troubled by the angry, destructive ghost of her baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved.
<br><br>
Sethe works at beating back the past, but it makes itself heard and felt incessantly in her memory and in the lives of those around her. When a mysterious teenage girl arrives, calling herself Beloved, Sethe's terrible secret explodes into the present.
<br><br>
Combining the visionary power of legend with the unassailable truth of history, Morrison's unforgettable novel is one of the great and enduring works of American literature.</p>

<h2 class="year">{{2017}}</h2>

<img height=300 alt="Book cover for Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1491119004i/31147619.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3> Homegoing </h3>
<h4> Yaa Gyasi </h4>
First published 2016 <br><br>

<p>Ghana, eighteenth century: two half sisters are born into different villages, each unaware of the other. One will marry an Englishman and lead a life of comfort in the palatial rooms of the Cape Coast Castle. The other will be captured in a raid on her village, imprisoned in the very same castle, and sold into slavery. 
<br><br>
Homegoing follows the parallel paths of these sisters and their descendants through eight generations: from the Gold Coast to the plantations of Mississippi, from the American Civil War to Jazz Age Harlem. Yaa Gyasi's extraordinary novel illuminates slavery's troubled legacy both for those who were taken and those who stayed-and shows how the memory of captivity has been inscribed on the soul of our nation.</p>
