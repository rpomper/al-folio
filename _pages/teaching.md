<h2> Eye-tracking workshop </h2>

<p> Co-creator (with Zoe Evans) of an eye-tracking workshop at Ohio State University. My part of the workshop included a tutorial on how to format automatic eye-tracking data to remove trials with too much missing data, check calibration quality for each participant, and downsample from 60 Hz to 30 Hz to combine with handcoded data. 
It also included 3 different methods for analyzing eye-tracking data: 
<ol type='1'> 
    <li><b>Accuracy</b> in fixating the target image averaged across a critical window</li> 
    <li><b>CBP</b> cluster-based permutation analyses to determine regions of significance during the critical window</li>
    <li><b>GCA</b> growth curve analyses to quantify changes in accuracy across the critical window</li>
</ol>
<p> You can access the raw data and R scripts <a href="https://github.com/rpomper/rpomper.github.io/tree/master/assets/vwp">here</a>. The data are from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15475441.2021.1947289?journalCode=hlld20">Pomper, Kaushanskaya & Saffran (2022)</a>.
