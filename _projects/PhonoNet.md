This project is funded by the <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10609433">NIH</a>. It investigates how the phonological structure of children's vocabularies affects their ability to learn new words and whether this varies between children with and without Developmental Language Disorder (DLD).

<h2> What we did </h2>

<p>Children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) struggle to learn new words. They
require more exposures to learn novel word-referent pairings than their peers with typical language development (Kan & Windsor, 2010). This problem persists into adulthood and is especially pronounced in their ability to learn the forms of novel words (McGregor, Arbisi-Kelm, Eden, & Oleson, 2020; Pomper, McGregor, Arbisi-Kelm, Eden, & Ohlmann, 2022).</p>

<p>This project investigates how knowledge of other words in English affects children’s ability to learn new words. The central hypothesis is that the phonological structure of children’s vocabularies affects their success in learning new words. In this project, phonological structure will be quantified using clustering coefficients, <i>C</i>, which is a metric from network science that measures levels of interconnectivity within different regions of the network.</p>

<p><i>C</i> quantifies the extent to which phonological neighbors
of a target word (i.e., words that differ only by the addition, subtraction, or substitution of a single phoneme) are also phonological neighbors of each other. For a word with high C, many of its neighbors are also neighbors (i.e., high interconnectivity). For a word with low C, few of its neighbors are also neighbors (i.e., low interconnectivity). Prior research has demonstrated a
strong effect of C on word learning for adults with typical language development when tested after a delay (Goldstein & Vitevitch, 2014).</p>
