This project is part of the <a href="https://www.boystownhospital.org/research/speech-language/word-learning/childrens-vocabulary-project">Children's Vocabulary Project</a> in the <a href="https://www.boystownhospital.org/research/speech-language/word-learning/">Word Learning Lab</a> at Boys Town National Research Hospital.
The Children's Vocabulary Project is a longitudinal project funded by the <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10194443">NIH</a> that aims to establish a developmental trajectory of word learning for children with DLD and the underlying cognitive mechanisms.

<h2> What we did </h2>

<h5> How do children infer the meanings of words? </h5>

<p>When we encounter an unfamiliar word, we often use context (the other words in the sentence & paragraph) to infer its meaning. Children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) struggle to learn new words. In this project, we compared how well children with and without DLD infer the meanings of words while reading and listening to short paragraphs.</p>

<p>To do this, we selected texts from grade-appropriate readers. From each text, we replaced one noun, one adjective, and one verb with blanks. We then asked 9- to 11-year-old children with and without DLD to guess the word that best fit in each blank.</p>

<h2> What we learned </h2>

<p>Children's guesses were scored as correct if they matched any of the words included in a set of 20 adults' responses. "Incorrect" guesses, those that were not include, in the adults' responses fell into several different categories: 
<ul>
  <li>Semantic: although technically true, the word is too generic or vauge</li>
  <li>Repetition: repeat of a word from the paragraph/sentence</li>
  <li>Syntactic: sentence is not grammatically correct</li>
  <li>IDK: "I don't know" or did not respond</li>
  <li>Unrelated: does not fit the theme of the paragraph/sentence</li>
  <li>Phrase: a multi-word answer (instructed to provide one word)</li>
  <li>Word Form: a made-up word (often resembling a real word)</li>
</ul>
